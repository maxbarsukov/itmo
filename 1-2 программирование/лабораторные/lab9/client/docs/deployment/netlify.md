# Deploy to Netlify

### Easy 5-Step Deployment Process

_Step 1:_ Create a `netlify.toml` file in the root directory of your project and copy this code below. Edit these settings if you did not follow the boilerplate structure. More settings available here (https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#sample-file)

```
[build]
  # Directory to change to before starting a build.
  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
  base = "/"

  # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready
  # HTML files and assets generated by the build. If a base directory has
  # been specified, include it in the publish directory path.
  publish = "./build"

  # Default build command.
  command = "CI= yarn run build"

# The following redirect is intended for use with most SPAs that handle routing internally.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

_Step 2:_ Commit your code and push your latest updates to a GitHub repository.

_Step 3:_ Register or Login in at [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

_Step 4:_ In your account | team page click `New site from git` then chose your repository.

_Step 5:_ Click deploy.

> Note: No need to change any setting in the last step as `netlify.toml` overwrites these settings.

Now your code will be deployed automatically to Netlify on every push to the default branch of your repository.ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³
